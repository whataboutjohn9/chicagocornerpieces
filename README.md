### *Part 1 - The Daily Chicago Trivia Trail*

**The Chicago Trail** is a daily trivia game that mashes up the high-stakes survival of *The Oregon Trail* with the gritty, hyper-local knowledge of Chicago. Navigate the city's neighborhoods, avoid "pothole dysentery," and see if you can make it to the lakefront without running out of giardiniera.
